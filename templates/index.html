  <h3>About Orriona GPS Tracker</h3>
  <p>
    Orriona is a DIY GPS tracking solution designed for precision and real-time location tracking. The tracker integrates the
    <strong>Wemos D1</strong> microcontroller, which is based on the <strong>ESP8266</strong> Wi-Fi module, and the <strong>NEO-6M</strong> GPS module.
    This system is ideal for applications requiring continuous GPS tracking with embedded data logging capabilities.
  </p>

  <h4>Wemos D1 and NEO-6M GPS Tracker Overview</h4>
  <p>
    The <strong>Wemos D1</strong> board serves as the core microcontroller. It's equipped with the ESP8266 chip, which provides Wi-Fi connectivity. The
    <strong>NEO-6M GPS module</strong> receives GPS signals from satellites, processes them, and communicates the position data to the Wemos D1.
    The Wemos D1 then sends the location data via Wi-Fi to the server or logs it for later use.
  </p>

  <h5>How Does the NEO-6M GPS Module Work?</h5>
  <p>
    The NEO-6M GPS module works by receiving signals from the GPS satellites orbiting Earth. Once it gets a signal from at least three satellites, it can
    calculate its latitude, longitude, and altitude with great accuracy. This information is sent to the Wemos D1, which acts as the interface between the
    GPS module and your network, enabling real-time tracking.
